The "KeyError: 1" you're encountering in the "update states based on hit counts" section typically suggests that the progression_states list does not contain a state that is being referenced by index. To fix this, we can ensure that we correctly manage state transitions based on existing states in the state_map.

Hereâ€™s the modified section of the code to handle state updates and avoid the KeyError:

# Update states based on hit counts
for track_id, track in enumerate(tracks):
    current_state = state_map.get(track_id, None)
    if current_state is not None:  # Ensure the current state exists
        current_state_index = progression_states.index(current_state)
        
        # Check if hit counts meet criteria for transitioning to 'Firm'
        if hit_counts[track_id] >= firm_threshold and current_state != 'Firm':
            state_map[track_id] = 'Firm'
            firm_ids.add(track_id)
            state_transition_times.setdefault(track_id, {})['Firm'] = current_time
            
        # Check for other state transitions
        elif current_state_index < len(progression_states) - 1:
            next_state = progression_states[current_state_index + 1]
            if hit_counts[track_id] >= current_state_index + 1 and state_map[track_id] != next_state:
                state_map[track_id] = next_state
                state_transition_times.setdefault(track_id, {})[next_state] = current_time

        track['current_state'] = state_map[track_id]

Full Adjusted Code Snippet

Replace the section in your main function with the code above. Here's how the complete part looks:

# Update states based on hit counts
for track_id, track in enumerate(tracks):
    current_state = state_map.get(track_id, None)
    if current_state is not None:  # Ensure the current state exists
        current_state_index = progression_states.index(current_state)
        
        # Check if hit counts meet criteria for transitioning to 'Firm'
        if hit_counts[track_id] >= firm_threshold and current_state != 'Firm':
            state_map[track_id] = 'Firm'
            firm_ids.add(track_id)
            state_transition_times.setdefault(track_id, {})['Firm'] = current_time
            
        # Check for other state transitions
        elif current_state_index < len(progression_states) - 1:
            next_state = progression_states[current_state_index + 1]
            if hit_counts[track_id] >= current_state_index + 1 and state_map[track_id] != next_state:
                state_map[track_id] = next_state
                state_transition_times.setdefault(track_id, {})[next_state] = current_time

        track['current_state'] = state_map[track_id]

Summary of Changes

1. Added a check to ensure current_state is not None before trying to access progression_states.


2. Maintained the logic for transitioning to the 'Firm' state and managing other state transitions based on hit counts.



Additional Tips

Make sure that progression_states is always populated correctly, and that every possible current state is in it.

It might be helpful to add logging or print statements to monitor state transitions and the values of hit_counts and state_map if errors persist.
